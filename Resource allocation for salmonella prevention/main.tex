\section{Introduction}

% The dawn of mankind did not only mark the beginnging of the human race. It also marked the beginning 
% of a battle between this new organism, `mankind', and the previous residents of this planet-
% microorganisms. As we live and breathe, we blatantly ignore our cohabitants, bacteria and viruses.
% However, we are never free from their clutches. Every year, millions of humans undergo a period-
% may be as short as a day or as long as several years- of struggle, battling against the 
% effects of bacteria such as E.coli (Escherichia coli), Salmonella, Streptococcus pyogenes, 
% Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium botulinum, etc. These bacteria thrive on certain ambient 
% conditions and environments. These environments can be of varying characterisitcs. Some thrive 
% in moist, cold environments and some in hot environments and then some others in different kinds 
% of surfaces. For example, halophiles trive on high salt concentrations while Barophiles thrive on
% high pressure conditions. 

\subsection{The central tenets of Machine Learning}
\label{sec: The central tenets of Machine Learning}
Machine learning (ML) is a field that primarily focuses on predicting some outcome, given some data. The central
tenet of using such a framework is that the input variables that are used are somehow correlated 
with the outcome. For example, in the popular iris dataset, the input variables are the sepal and petal
characterisitcs and the outcome is one of three species of the iris flower. The secondary tenet is 
that no observation made in this world is by itself the true representation of what is being observed and 
so \textit{all observations} are noisy (contain noisy information). Thus, it follows that a single 
prediction made from a single noisy observation is also noisy (Noisy input gives noisy output). However,
time and time again, such predictions have proven helpful. For example, a $\geq90\%$ accurate transformer
is deemed capable enough to complete incomplete passages or poems, computer vision systems are used to 
identify objects, understand human sentiments, etc. These wonders are due to the fact that all phenomena
are generated by probability distributions and a random sample approaches a limiting probability
distribution as the size of the sample increases. Thus, even though the learner is unaware of the underlying 
limiting distribution, as we increase the sample size, the particular error-correction algorithm of the learner
leads it towards the true prediction. 

\subsection{Quantitative decisions in socal policy making}
ML techniques have been used primarily to make tasks more efficient, not to induce social policy and decision.
We trust qualitative arguments when deciding where to build a hospital or where to put more health care funding.
One explanation for this is that we can determine biases in an argument instantly and doing the same for 
a learner is much harder, simply due to the secondary tenet (see \ref{sec: The central tenets of Machine 
Learning}). Another reason for the insuitability of ML techniques in this area is that the predictions do 
not take into account \textit{its own effects} on downstream decisions. But where we have not trusted 
predictions, we have trusted optimization and statistical testing. Optimization techniques have been heavily 
relied on when the answer to a problem is deemed to be deterministic. Examples
of such problems include The Travelling Salesman proble, The Knapsack problem, etc. Optimization problems
differ from Machine Learning problems in that the problem is not solved using data but rather a fixed set 
of conditions. This fixed set contains a function relating the inputs to the output and equations that 
give the `feasible answer region'. But there are numerous problems where we don't have a function that 
gives the input-output relationship but yet we want to optimize the inputs for either maximizing or minimizing
the output based on some constraints on the inputs. For example, 

Another area that contains techniques that lead to decisions from data as opposed to predictions from data 
is statistical hypothesis testing.
